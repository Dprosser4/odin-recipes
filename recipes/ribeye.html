<h2>Basic Ribeye Facts and Recipe:</h2>
    <p>Ribeyes are my favorite cut of beef.</p>
    <p>The "cap" of the ribeye is, in my opinion, the best piece of meat on the entire animal.</p>
  
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ribeye Steak (about 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>  
      <li>Pepper</li>  
      <li>A high smokepoint oil like avocado oil or ghee.</li>
      

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a cast iron pan as hot as you can.</li>
        <li>Add oil.</li>
        <li>Pull ribeye from the fridge and season generously with salt and a few cracks of pepper.</li>
        <li>Immediately lay meat in the pan and do not move for 3-4 minutes</li>
        <li>Flip steak and cook for another 3-4 minutes depending on thickness and desired level of doneness. </li>
        <li>Remove steak and plate. Let it rest for a 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
